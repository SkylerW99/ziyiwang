        My current research questions are:
      </h2>

      <p>
        1. How do languages change the way we think, in the aspect of inner
        monologue? (visual nonverbal thoughts; music/sound playing in the brain)
        <br />
        2. How can develop a shared langauge and bridge the language barrier?
        (for Chinese and English, maybe in the lens of borrowed words)
        <br />
        3. How does langage related to cultural confidence? (the accent)
      </p>

        1. Silenc
      </h3>

      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Visualization of silent letters by eliminating or highlighting the
          silent letters
        </li>
        <li>
          All the silent letters are set in red text, when viewed with a red
          light filter, these letters disappear, leaving only the pronounced
          text (in Chinese, every character is phonetic; maybe that's a barrier
          of learning)
        </li>
        <li>
          Linkage to my research: The less phonetic the alphabet, the harder to
          correctly say the words
        </li>
      </ul>

        2. Found in Translation
      </h3>

      <p>
        Using their own spoken sentences, visitors viscerally experience the
        process of machine translation. Visualizations show how the machine
        learning model clusters words from different languages by semantic
        similarity, and translations are presented typographically and
        auditorily across 24 languages.
      </p>

      <p>
        An exploration of language in the aspect of how meanings are formed in
        langauge. A generative design work where the Latin alphabet is
        transformed into abstract geometry using 3–screen–projection.

        4. Works from Artist Xu Bing
        (Boundless Book; Book from the Gound; Suqare word Calligraphy)
      </h3>

      <p>
        His use of symbols, emojis to convey meaning is
        super interesting. In the project "Square word calligraphy", he remixed one of remix of forms and meanings
        in Chinese and English.

        I use affinity map, trying to find a common ground between
        Mandarin and English. After that, I did cultural Comparion.

      <h3>
        Takeaway from interview of bilingual speakers
      </h3>
      <p>
        1. Many bilingual speakers find themselves unable to speak one language
        during conversation, they would incorporate another language into the
        conversation.
        <br />
        2. Inner monologue: many of us don’t do inner monologues when speaking
        the language that they are more comfortable with. People would rehearse
        sometime when they are going to speak a language they are less familiar
        with.
        <br />
        3. They think some meanings have lost during translation. So when they 
        are arguing about something, they are more inclined to use mother tone 
        to express anger precisely.
        
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        Approaches i'm considering
      </h3>
      <p>
        1. Memes and emojis as visual language (the way the same emojis being
        interpreted differently accross cultures; cultural icons)
        <br />
        2. Reducing languages to icons in the same way that a human body can be
        reduced to a shape or an icon
        <br />
        3. The idea of developing a shared language (remixing languages: I mix
        Chinese and English a lot during conversation)
        <br />
        4. What if we are actually think and act like computers
      (for example, Chinese language being a window system and English become
        a Mac) 
         <br /> 
        5. Personification of the words [褒义词(words with positive
        meanings), 贬义词（words with negative meanings); maybe through the lens
        of chroeography and body movement] 
         <br />
        6. Learning to music as a way of
        learning language (i cannot read "a little bit dangerous" by sing it as
        the lyric in Ariana's song) 
         <br />
        7. Homophonic characters in Chinese (words
        with same prounication but different structures) 
         <br />
        8. Find a metaphor that
        represents the patterns in different language 
        <br />
        9. The lost of meanings during translation
        <br />
        10. The relation between borrowed words and food. (
        as I found borrowed Chinese word in English are names
        of food.)
