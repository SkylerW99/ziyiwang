      <p>
      I use prototype 2 as the testing for the concept feasibility. I bought some steel 
        wires and began morph them into the geometric shapes that assemble the abstract 
        shape of the human silhouette. Then I made a form board box that holds the hanging 
        steel wire. I tried to separate the shapes into different layers to create a 
        perspective effect.

      I went to MOMA to see the kinetic art exhibition that features 
      <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/kinetic-art#!#resultType:masonry">Alexander Calder's </a>steel wire 
      installations. I get inspired about his material usage, kinetic 
      movement, and minimalistic aesthetics.

    <p>
      I found it's hard for the viewers to associate the front installation 
      with the projection at the back because I failed to execute the shape and
      position of the steel wire precisely. I learnt I need to focus on the 
      visual execution for the final output.
