        Following the idea of creating a filter to change the sightseeing experience, we used yellow and blue 
        transparent film paper, and cardboard to create a viewfinder for passers-by to look through. We stick 
        the blue transparent paper at the outer side of the cardboard viewfinder, and insert the yellow filter 
        in the middle of it. The yellow layer is removable. If being removed, they would see the blue filter. 
        If not, they would see the overlay effect of a green filter with the combination of yellow and blue. 

        Our goal of testing is to see if people would see through, play with the removeable yellow filter or 
        take photos through it.

      Some people were curious about our installation and asked us about it 
      when we were setting up. People are reluctant to touch it (probably 
      because it looks flimsy). Several people look through the filter, but 
      their attention span was pretty short. They soon walked away without touching it.

      <h2>
        Insight 
      </h2>
      
    <p>
      1. The removable filter affordance needs to be more clear. Possible solution 
      could be using upward arrow tabs. 
      <br>
      <br>
      2. Our prototype fell down several times. The base needs to be wide and heavier 
      to withstand wind. We need to make our intervention more inviting. 
      <br>
      <br>
     3. In the aspect of adding historical context to the sightseeing experience, we 
      could print the historical picture of the same spot to the transparent film. 
      Also, we could place a dot behind the installation to remind people to look through.
