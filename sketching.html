       I tracked the English language learning progress of me and two close friends 
        whose mother language is mandarin. And all of us has been to an English speaking 
        country for several years.

      2. My procrastination Pattern

    <p>
      I started with my daily activity tracking on paper, and found three important 
      factors that explains my procrastination pattern: phone usage, hours of sleep 
      and daily workload.

    <p>
      What makes me sleep less is not my workload, instead, it’s my PROCRASTINATION.
I fall into the “naive people” category in the econ model, and I didn’t realize that…
“Present bias”: people give more weight to the payoffs that are closer to the current time.
